Australian Standard Garrat (ASG) locomotive for the Minetest mod Advanced Trains

This repo mainly servs as a way to put the WIP model up for adoption after I ran out of patience with Blender. The model may or may not be refined in the future if I decide to give it another go, so take it as it is.

Below are my reference sources:

 - A Royal Inquiry into the the usefulness of the ASG after a while in service. Has some pretty handy diagrams which I traced to get the basic shape of the model:

 - Rail Heritage WA Archive. Has a fair few pics of the ASG in use on the Western Australian Government Railways network, including Builders Photos. Search for "ASG" and tick "Loco - Vehicle Class" and/or "2nd Loco - Vehicle Class"
